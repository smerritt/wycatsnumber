        <p>Maybe there's a typo in their GitHub username. Does their
          username have OddLY PlACeD CaPiTaL LeTT3Rs? If so, you'll just
          have to put a little extra wear and tear on your shift key and
          type it in; these things are case-sensitive.</p>

        <p>Maybe they're just not big open-source contributors. If they
          haven't contributed to any public projects on GitHub, there's no
          way <th></th>at our GitHub-crawling robots can find them. The
          robots can't see private repositories.</p>

        <p>Maybe they're off in their own little world. They could have
          commits in public projects, but there's just no way to reach our
          arbitrarily-chosen starting point
          of <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">rails/rails</a> from
          their repositories.</p>

        <p>Maybe they've only recently started contributing. The data
          that our graph is built from may be up to a month stale. This is
          because GitHub has a rate limiter on their API, and so the
          robots can only check them for updates every so often.</p>

        <p>And maybe, of course, there's a bug in our code
          somewhere. <a href="https://github.com/smerritt/wycatsnumber">Take
          a look and see if you can spot it</a>.

          Maybe the server's on fire. You can try again, but
          you may have to wait until someone puts the server out.</p>
