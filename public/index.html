          <dt>Why wycats?</dt>

          <dd>Paul Erdos worked with a whole bunch of different
            mathematicians, and so he makes a natural center for the
            mathematical community. Likewise, Yehuda Katz worked with
            a whole bunch of people on a whole bunch of important Ruby
            projects, so he makes a natural center for the Ruby
            community.</dd>

          <dt>That's dumb. Clearly, so-and-so is the logical choice.</dt>

          <dd>Fine. You can get your so-and-so number too; just type
            their GitHub username into the box.</dd>

          <dt>Why don't I have a wycats number of 1? I totally have a
            fork of Rails that I've committed a bunch of stuff to.</dt>

          <dd>Forks don't count. Your commits to Rails have to make it
            to the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">canonical
              repository</a>. Same goes for forks of any other
            projects.</dd>

          <dt>Can't I just make some public project on my repository,
            make a couple commits as me@example.com, and then a couple
            using wycats's email address?</dt>

          <dd>Yes, but please don't. It's like peeing in the pool:
            you'll feel good for a minute, but if others notice, they'll
            think you're a jerk.</dd>
